## Use of TelemetryDeck to analyze app usage

We use the privacy-friendly analytics service TelemetryDeck (provider: TelemetryDeck GmbH, Von-der-Tann-Str. 54, 86159 Augsburg, Germany) to analyze usage data. The use is based on Art. 6 para. 1 lit. b GDPR, as we require reliable and efficient tools for collecting app usage data in order to fulfill the contract with you, our customer.

## What data is transferred?

The data processed by TelemetryDeck is completely anonymized and does not allow any conclusions to be drawn about personal information.

The following data is collected, among other things:

    an anonymized, untraceable user ID (per app installation),
    actions defined by the app publisher (e.g., "app launched," "settings opened"),
    a rounded timestamp (to the nearest hour),
    device metadata (e.g., system version, app version, device type),
    additional metadata defined by the app publisher (e.g., "number of items in the database").

## What is not stored?

    No IP addresses (not in logs, not in the database),
    No cookies or tracking technologies,
    no persistent identifiers that could be traced back to individuals.

The source code of the TelemetryDeck SDK is completely open source and available on GitHub: https://github.com/TelemetryDeck
